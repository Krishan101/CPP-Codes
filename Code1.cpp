/*Create a class named 'Member' having the following members:
Data members

It also has a function named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the members.
Two classes 'Employee' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. The 'Employee' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 
'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an employee and a manager by making an object of both of these 
classes and print the same.*/
